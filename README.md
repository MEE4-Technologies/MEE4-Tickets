# MEE4 Ticket Bot
## Introduction
This is a simple bot that can be used to create tickets in Discord. It is written in JavaScript in the Discord.js V14 Library. The bot was made to be a Tickets Bot to the
MEE4 Support Server. We have not yet decided to make this bot public, and will not for the next few months.
## Commands
`/open-ticket`
<br>
This command will create a ticket channel. Only the user who executed the command and the Support Team are permitted to view the ticket.
<br>
`/close-ticket`
<br>
This command will close the ticket channel. This locks the channel for everyone except admins.
<br>
`/delete-ticket`
<br>
This command will delete the ticket channel. This command can only be used by the Support Team or any Admin. This command deletes a ticket immediately, however it is recommended that you close the ticket first before you delete it.
<br>
